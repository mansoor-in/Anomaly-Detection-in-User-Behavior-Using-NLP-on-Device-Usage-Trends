# Anomaly Detection in User Behavior Using NLP on Device Usage Trends

This project focuses on identifying anomalies in user behavior by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze device usage trends. The implementation is designed to detect unusual patterns in user interactions, providing insights into potential security risks or unusual activities.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Extracts and processes user behavior data based on device usage trends.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes NLP techniques for trend analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outliers and unusual patterns in user behavior.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Presents findings using graphs and charts for better understanding.
